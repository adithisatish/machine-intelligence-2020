# Designing a Neural Network using NumPy
## Machine Intelligence - Assignment 3

Design of a neural network to implement a binary classifier using the ```LBW_Dataset.csv ``` dataset file.

Functions Implemented:
- ```dataCleaning```: Function to clean the dataset, using mean, median and mode replacement methods.
- ```boxplots```: Function to plot boxplots for an attribute of a dataframe.
- ```NN.fit```: Method of class NN, used to train the neural network using the X_train and y_train parameters.
- ```NN.predict```: Method of class NN, returns the predicted class (y_hat) that a test instance has been classifed as. 
- ```NN.CM```: Method of class NN to print the confusion matirx by taking y_pred and y_test as parameters.

### Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

### Run
Execute ```python Neural_Net.py```

Implemented in Python.
