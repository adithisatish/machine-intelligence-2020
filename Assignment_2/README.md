# Search Algorithms - DFS, UCS and A*
## Machine Intelligence - Assignment 2

Functions Implemented:
- ```DFS_Traversal``` : Depth-First Search
- ```UCS_Traversal``` : Uniform Cost Search
- ```A_star_Traversal``` : A* Search
- ```tri_traversal``` : Implements all three search algorithms

### Run
A sample test case has been provided in order to test the functions.
    
```python3 sample_test_case.py```

Graph used as the sample test:
<img src="sample_graph.png" alt="drawing" style="width:20px; height:20px"/>

Implemented in Python.
